The Palmer penguins data contains size measurements for three different penguin species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.
These data were collected from 2007 - 2009 by Dr. Kristen Gorman with the Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research Program, part of the US Long Term Ecological Research Network.
The sampling grid was from the Anvers region, and the penguins are of the Eukaryota domain, which usually lay 2 eggs. At the time of sampling, the penguins were all adults and had 1 egg in each nest.

#Description
The dataset used was obtained from Kaggle and it consists of 17 columns, 344 rows and 0 duplicate values. For the purpose of this analysis 9 columns would be used.

•	Species: penguin species (Chinstrap, Adélie, or Gentoo)
•	Island: location where sample was collected (Dream, Torgersen, or Biscoe)
•	Clutch completion: denotes if the penguin completed their clutch i.e eventually laid the second egg
•	Date egg: the date study nest was observed with 1 egg
•	Culmen length(mm): the length of the dorsal ridge of a bird's bill
•	Culmen depth(mm): the depth of the dorsal ridge of a bird's bill
•	Flipper lenght(mm): the length of the penguin's flipper
•	Body mass(kg): weight of the penguin
•	Sex: gender of the penguin
